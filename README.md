> **Notes on dataset:**

- Tables are not uniform in structure (variation in fields/columns), owing to the range of periods and geographic locations the dataset comes from
- Handwriting styles vary due to differences in human-writers and periods
- Noise is present in the form of ink blots, parchment texture, or general wear and tear of the physical documents

> Matricula images were scraped using [austrian_register_project/Scraper at main · sodalabsio/austrian_register_project (github.com)](https://github.com/sodalabsio/austrian_register_project/tree/main/Scraper); originally <https://github.com/1fge/matricula-online-scraper>
